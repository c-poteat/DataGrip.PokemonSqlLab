weakest trainer. You may interpret strongest in whatever way you want, but you will have to explain your decision.

Turning in this assignment
To turn in this assignment, create files for each part with at least one query for each question answered. Above each query include a comment with the question you were answering. The files should have the extension .sql Example:

 # How many characters are in the string 'Hello World!'
 SELECT CHAR_LENGTH('Hello World!') AS length_of_hello_world
For Part 4 specifically also leave a comment explaining how your query is deciding who the strongest trainer is

Once all of that is done, submit your file by saving it in the "answers" directory and committing it to your fork.
